Welcome to my Machine Learning Project aimed at predicting Avian Flu epidemics. The source data is from the USDA (data link: https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-2022/2022-hpai-wild-birds).

The code has been written in a Jupyter notebook in google colab environment. The overall preocedure involves data cleaning and pre-processing followed by feature engineering and selection. Finally, three ML classification algorithms are applied to the data namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest and Logistic Regression.

The classification preocedures gave promising results in its ability to classify situations from epidemic to non epidemic like. Further documentataion about the code is written inside it. Please reach out to me if you ahve any questions. Thanks!
